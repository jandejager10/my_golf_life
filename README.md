# Welcome
Welcome to my "Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development" Milestone Project 1.
At the time of writing this I have only a vague idea of what I want this project to be about and very little time to spend on it as well - Let that be the end of the excuses.

# Goal
	# External userâ€™s goal:
		The site's users are amateur and professional golfers, looking for golf courses to play at, kit and equipment to buy.

	# Site owner's goal:
		The site is interested in selling a lot of kit and equipment.

	# Potential features to include:
		Allow for trade-in of older equipment for resale.

		Assist with booking and travel arrangements.

		Assist with training guides and/or rainers for young and old.
