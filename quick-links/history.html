golf
, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a smallball with various clubs from a series of starting points(teeing grounds) into a series of holes on a course. Theplayer who holes his ball in the fewest strokes wins. Theorigins of the game are difficult to ascertain, althoughevidence now suggests that early forms of golf were playedin
the Netherlands first and then in Scotland.
From a somewhat obscure antiquity, the game attained worldwide popularity, especially inthe 20th century. Nothing is known about the early game’s favourite venues on theEuropean continent, but in Scotland golf was first played on seaside links with their crispturf and natural hazards. Only later in the game’s evolution did play on downs, moorland,and parkland courses begin. Golfers participate at every level, from a recreational game topopular televised professional tournaments. Despite its attractions, golf is not a game foreveryone; it requires a high degree of skill that is honed only with great patience anddedication.
History
Origins
The origin of golf has long been debated. Some historians trace the sport back to theRoman game of
paganica
, which involved using a bent stick to hit a wool- or feather-stuffed leather ball. According to one view,
paganica
spread throughout several countries asthe Romans conquered much of Europe during the 1st century
BC
and eventually evolvedinto the modern game. Others cite
chuiwan
(
ch’ui-wan
) as the progenitor, a game played inChina during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and earlier and described as “a game in whichyou hit a ball with a stick while walking.”
Chuiwan
is thought to have been introduced intoEurope by traders during the Middle Ages. However, upon close examination, neithertheory is convincing.
Other early stick-and-ball games included the English game of
cambuca
(a term of Celticorigin). In France the game was known as
chambot
and may have been related to Irish
hurling
and Scottish
shinty
, or
camanachd
, as well as to the French pastime (derived froman Italian game) of
jeu de mail
. This game was in turn exported to the Low Countries,Germany, and England (where it was called
pall-mall
, pronounced “pell mell”).

As early as 1819 the English traveler William Ousely claimed that golf descended from thePersian national game of
chaugán
, the ancestor of modern
polo
. Later, historians, not leastbecause of the resemblance of names, considered the French cross-country game of
chicane
to be a descendant of
chaugán
. In
chicane
a ball had to be driven with the fewest possiblestrokes to a church or garden door. This game was described in the novels of
Émile Zola
and Charles Deulin, where it went by the name of
chole
.
Chicane
closely resembled the game of
kolf
, which the Dutch golf historian J.H. vanHengel believed to be the earliest form of golf. Many traditions surround the game of
kolf
.One relates that it was played annually in the village of Loenen, Netherlands, beginning in1297, to commemorate the capture of the killer of
Floris V
, count of Holland and Zeeland, ayear earlier. No evidence supports this early date, however, and it would seem to be a clearanachronism.
Based on the evidence, it may well be that golf came into being only a little before the 15thcentury. It may be conceived as a domesticated form of such medieval games as football, inwhich the size of the goals and the ball was radically reduced and in which, as aconsequence, the element of violence had to give way to the element of skill. Seen fromthis perspective, golf would be the result of the process of civilization as described in thework of German-born sociologist Norbert Elias.
Scots as inventors: a popular fallacy
For many years it was believed that golf originated in
Scotland. This belief rested on threereferences in Scottish acts of Parliament from the second half of the 15th century. In aresolution of the 14th Parliament, convened in Edinburgh on March 6, 1457, the games offootball and golf (“futbawe and ye golf”) were banned with a vengeance (“utterly crytdone”). This ban was repeated in 1471 when Parliament thought it “expedient [th]at…yefutbal and golf be abusit.” In a resolution passed in 1491, football, golf, and other uselessgames were outlawed altogether (“fut bawis gouff or uthir sic unproffitable sports”). Inaddition, these texts enjoined the Scottish people to practice
archery
, a sport which might beput to good use in defending the country.
In more recent times the validity of these sources has been called into question on twogrounds. First, pictorial evidence now seems to point to a continental European origin ofgolf. The earliest golfing picture is a miniature in a
book of hours
formerly owned byAdelaïde of Savoy, the duchess of Burgundy. Executed about the middle of the 15th century(Chantilly, Musée Condé, MS 76), it predates the earliest of the Scottish sources quoted
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 3/25
above. The miniature from Adelaïde’s book is, in turn, the forerunner of the well-knownexample from a book of hours in the British Library that is ascribed variously to theworkshops of two Flemish artists,
Simon Bening (c. 1483–1561) and Gerard Horenbout
(c.1465–1541), both of whom were active in the Ghent-Bruges school in the first half of the16th century. There is yet another miniature, from the book of hours of
Philip I
(theHandsome), the son of Emperor Maximilian I (Colegio Real de Corpus Christi, Valencia).Created in 1505, one year before Philip’s death, it shows golfers in the process of swingingand putting.
In addition to the books of hours, there are engravings that highlight golf.
Playing Monkeys
,by Pieter van der Borcht (1545–1608), features a monkey taking a swing at a teed ball, and
Venus, Protectress of Lovers
, by Pieter Janszoon Saenredam (1597–1665), shows, in themargins of a picture of an embracing couple with Venus and Cupid, some people playinggames such as football and golf. The latter work is a copy of an earlier work by engraver
Hendrik Goltzius
(1558–1617).
The earliest known scenes depicting golf in Scotland are found in two paintings dated 1680(or 1720) and 1746–47. The earlier work is an oil painting by an unknown artist whodepicted a gentlemen foursome and two caddies against the backdrop of the town of St.Andrews. The second, a watercolour by the Englishman Paul Sandby (1725–1809), shows asquad of soldiers fighting over a golf ball in the shrubbery at the foot of Edinburgh Castle.
As to the Scottish acts of Parliament, the difficulty there lies in the uncertainty concerningthe meaning of the term
golf
in 15th-century Scotland. In the equally controversial debateabout the origins of cricket, British historian Eric Midwinter pointed out that a sport’sprovenance cannot be proved by a mere textual reference to a game unless the context andthe meaning of the reference are exactly known:
Thus, by the strictest definition of historical evidence, we require both the name, and its [beingattached] to some description which is recognizable cricket, before it is safe to talk about theorigin of the game.
The Scottish sources fail to meet this standard for the origins of golf.
As early as 1360 the magistrate of Brussels issued an ordinance according to which anyonecaught playing a similar club-and-ball game was threatened with a fine of 20 shillings orconfiscation of his upper garment (“Item. wie met coluen tsolt es om twintich scell’ oft ophare ouerste cleet.”). While it seems plausible that
met coluen
(which is the dative plural of
colve
, of which
kolf
, meaning “with clubs,” is a variant) yielded the Scots loanword
golf
, it
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 4/25
is clear from the verb
tsollen
(from the French
souler
, “to play football”) that the textenvisaged the rough competitive team game of
soule
played with a curved stick.
That on the Continent
kolve
primarily denoted a hockey stick becomes evident from the
Boek van Merline
(1261), poet
Jacob van Maerlant
’s translation of
Robert de Boron
’s
Livrede Merlin
, in which young Merlin is engaged in a game of
soule à la crosse
(hockey).Where in the French source Merlin viciously hits one of his playmates with a
crosse
(ahockey stick), in Maerlant’s Flemish version the word used is
kolve
. Proof that golf inScotland had exactly the same meaning as its Flemish counterpart
kolve
comes in
The Buikof Alexander the Conqueror
, a translation, by Sir Gilbert Hay (c. 1460), of the medieval
Roman d’Alexandre
. In Hay’s French source, Alexander the Great had received a ball(
estuef
) and a hockey stick (
crosse
) from the king of Persia. In his Scots version, Hayrendered
crosse
into
golf-staff
and further alludes to the stick as a means with which tochase the Persian emperor and his lords to and fro like a ball in a hockey match. Such adescription leaves hardly any doubt that in 15th-century Scotland the term
golf
primarilyreferred to a fiercely contended team game, and this accounts for its being banned in theacts of Parliament quoted above.
A continental origin of golf is also suggested by a linguistic analysis of golfing terms and arecently discovered Dutch description of golf from the first half of the 16th century. Golfhistorians have long surmised that the terms
tee
and
stymie
are based on the Dutch word
tuitje
(a diminutive of
tuit
, meaning “snout”) and the phrase
stuit me
(meaning “hindersme”), but these derivations have been questioned on phonological grounds and thereforehave never been accepted by historical dictionaries. However, a Dutch origin of
tee
is stillplausible, as a variation of the Flemish
tese
, meaning “target” (as in
curling
); the wordoriginally referred to the hole but eventually came to mean a “pile of sand taken from thehole.” There are also good reasons to posit a Dutch origin for the words
putt
(from
putten
,“put into a hole”) and
bunker
(a possible back-formation of
bancaert kolve
).
However, the source most likely to tip the scales in favour of a Dutch origin is a phrasebooklet written by a Dutch schoolmaster, Pieter van Afferden, or Petrus Apherdianus(1510–80). The book,
Tyrocinium latinae linguae
(
Recruits’ Drill in the Latin Language
;1545), was intended to impart a knowledge of Latin in everyday situations by matchingLatin phrases with Dutch ones. This source predates the earliest Scottish description of golf—the 1636
Vocabula
by Scotsman David Wedderburn—by almost a century. Its remarkablefeature, however, is that in a chapter titled “De Clauis Plumbatis” (“On the [Game with the]Leaded Clubs”) it is much more explicit than other early sources. In the
Tyrocinium
the club
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 5/25
is indeed called a
kolve
, and the game as such is referred to as
kolven
(the infinitive of averb used as a noun). This confirms that the Scots word
golf
is indeed based on
kolve
or
kolf
. In the course of a dialogue in this text, the fictitious players also give the firstindication of the existence of rules. For instance, a golfer who misses the ball is said to losethe right to strike (wastes a stroke); to step onto the teeing ground before it is one’s turn isagainst the rules because a certain order of play has to be adhered to; a player must beallowed to swing freely, necessitating that other players step back; a golfer is not allowed tostand in the light of his partner; and, lastly, in order to putt, the ball has to be struck—merely pushing it is forbidden and is called a knavish trick. The hole, however, is called nota
put
but a
cuyl
. Generally speaking, then, the
Tyrocinium
proves that, by the middle of the16th century, golf in the Netherlands was a firmly established and rather sophisticatedgame.
Golf in Scotland
Despite the likelihood of a continental origin of golf,
King James IV
, who had prohibitedthe hockeylike game of golf earlier (in 1491), nevertheless became the first authenticatedplayer of “real” golf. That royalty were the leaders of this new sporting fashion is to beexpected. The route of transmission to Scotland was likely to have been Flemish traders andcraftsmen who had found employment at the Scottish court.
The lord high treasurer’s accounts for the years 1502, 1503, and 1506 include payments forthe king’s “golf clubbis and ballis” and other equipment during stays at Perth, Edinburgh,and St. Andrews. In addition, the entry for the year 1506 specifies the amount of threeFrench crowns lost by the king in a golfing bet (betting on the outcome of games waswidespread in the Middle Ages).
The Stuarts also gave the game its first woman golfer—
Mary
, Queen of Scots, who wascharged with playing in the fields beside Seton only a few days after the murder of herhusband,
Lord Darnley
. The contemporary account of the queen’s misconduct also makes itclear that at the time a golf club was still called a golf in Scotland. The fact that in Scotlandgolf counted royalty among its followers and the fact that the first pictorial representationsof the game are to be found in books of hours owned by members of the continental higharistocracy suggest that from the middle of the 15th century there are two games todistinguish: one was
kolve
/
kolf
, a variety of hockey that was popular with townspeople andthe peasantry, and the other was golf, the preserve of the upper crust of society. However,there is no evidence of the existence of the latter in Scotland much before the 16th century.

Development of golfers’ associations
Early
British societies
There is another provenance story that says James I introduced golf to Blackheath in 1608,long thought to be the year the historic
royal Blackheath Golf Club was founded. AlthoughKing James and his courtiers played golf somewhere in the vicinity, it is doubtful whetherany organized society then existed, and research has set the earliest date of such a societynearly two centuries later. W.E. Hughes, editor of the
Chronicles of Blackheath Golfers
,ascribes the club’s foundation to 1787.
The oldest club with documentary proof of its origin is the Gentlemen Golfers of Leith,now the
Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, whose modern home is at Muirfieldin East Lothian. Its genesis was a move by a group of players to hold a competition ortournament. In 1744 “several Gentlemen of Honour skillful in the ancient and healthfullexercise of Golf” petitioned the Edinburgh city council to provide a silver club for annualcompetition on the links of Leith. The Society of St. Andrews Golfers, now the
Royal andAncient Golf Club of St. Andrews
(R&A), Scotland, was formed in 1754 by a group of 22golfers who played there. The rules that the society adopted were almost identical to theEdinburgh Gentlemen Golfers’ rules. These two clubs played major roles in thedevelopment of the game in Scotland. Eventually the R&A became, by common consent,the oracle on rules. In 1919 it accepted the management of the Open Championship (alsoknown, particularly in the United States, as the British Open) and the British AmateurChampionship. The R&A thus became the governing body for golf in the British Isles andthroughout most of the Commonwealth.
With the birth of the
Royal North Devon Golf Club in 1864, golf took a firm foothold inEngland. The Devon club was the first course on seaside links outside Scotland. The
RoyalLiverpool Golf Club was established in 1869 on a rabbit warren at Hoylake. In its infancyplayers simply cut holes with their penknives and stuck feathers in them for the guidance ofthose who were coming behind. The rabbits were the greenskeepers. By 1870 the club wasfairly established, and members played matches against players from clubs such asBlackheath and the Royal North Devon Club at Westward Ho!. The Royal Liverpool Clubhosted Great Britain’s first Amateur Championship in 1885 and the first English AmateurChampionship in 1925. The first Scotland-England amateur match was organized in 1902,and it was at Hoylake in 1921 that an unofficial contest between British and U.S. players, acurtain-raiser to the Amateur Championship, was played and served as the genesis of the
Walker Cup
series.

The
United States and
Canada
The following advertisement, which appeared in James Rivington’s gazette in New York onApril 21, 1779, clearly refers to golf:
To the GOLF PLAYERS: The Season for this pleasant and healthy Exercise now advancing,Gentlemen may be furnished with excellent CLUBS and the veritable Caledonian BALLS, byenquiring at the Printer’s.
The
South Carolina and Georgia Almanac
of 1793 published, under the heading “SocietiesEstablished in Charleston,” the following item: “Golf Club Formed 1786.” The
CharlestonCity Gazette and Daily Advertiser
of September 18, 1788, reported: “There is lately erectedthat pleasing and genteel amusement, the KOLF BAAN.” However, this perhaps pointed tothe existence of an indoor facility for the Dutch game of
kolf
, a variety of the French
jeu demail
mentioned above. Later notices dated 1791 and 1794 referred to the South CarolinaGolf Club, which celebrated an anniversary with a dinner on Harleston’s Green in the latteryear. Although these fragments constitute the earliest clear evidence of golf clubs in theUnited States, the clubs appear to have been primarily social organizations that did notsurvive the War of 1812.
The first permanent golf club in the Western Hemisphere was the
Royal Montreal GolfClub, established in 1873. The members played on Fletcher’s Fields in the city’s centralarea until urban growth compelled a move of some miles to Dixie, a name derived from agroup of Southern refugees who arrived there after the U.S. Civil War. The Royal QuebecGolf Club was founded in 1874; the Toronto and Niagara, Ontario, clubs in 1876; and theBrantford, Ontario, club in 1879. In the meantime, golf was played experimentally at manyplaces in the United States without taking permanent root until, in 1885, it was played in
Foxburg, Pennsylvania. The Oakhurst Golf Club in West Virginia, which later became theGreenbrier Club, is said to have been formed in 1884; and the
Dorset Field Club in Dorset,Vermont, claims to have been organized and to have laid out its course in 1886, although inboth instances written records are lacking. The
Foxburg Golf Club has provided strongsupport for the claim that it was organized in 1887 and is the oldest golf club in the UnitedStates with a permanent existence. Foxburg also claims the oldest American golf course.
Golf as an organized game in the United States, however, usually is dated from thefounding of the
St. Andrew’s Golf Club at Yonkers, New York, in 1888. Its progenitor was
John Reid, a Scot from Dunfermline who became known as “the father of American golf.”Reid, on learning that fellow Scot Robert Lockhart was returning to the old country on

business, asked him to bring back some golf clubs and balls. This done, Reid and his friendJohn B. Upham tried them out on February 22, 1888, over an improvised three-hole layout.That fall, five men formed the club, and in the spring they moved to a course in an appleorchard. There, it is said, they hung their coats and a jug of good Scotch whisky in aconvenient apple tree, and they subsequently became known as the “Apple Tree Gang.” Theclub made its final move in 1897 to Mount Hope in Westchester county, New York.
Other early courses included Newport, Rhode Island (1890); Shinnecock Hills on LongIsland (1891); and the Chicago Golf Club (1892) at Wheaton, Illinois. The Tuxedo GolfClub in New York, founded in 1889, met the Shinnecock men in 1894 in what has beenassumed to be the first interclub match in the United States. The Newport club staged aninvitational tournament for amateurs in September 1894, and in October the St. Andrew’sclub promoted a similar competition. These were announced as championships, but thatwas questioned because the events were each promoted by a single club and on aninvitational basis. It was from the controversy roused by these promotions that the
UnitedStates Golf Association (USGA) was instituted in 1894. Its aims were to organize the U.S.Amateur and Open championships and to formulate a set of rules for the game. Thefounding fathers, two from each club, were from St. Andrew’s, Shinnecock Hills, Chicago,the Country Club at Brookline, and Newport. The U.S. national championships—theAmateur, the Women’s Amateur, and the Open—were inaugurated in 1895.
Other countries
Before organized clubs had been established in NorthAmerica, colonies of British settlers, merchants, andcivil servants carried golf with them.
India has theoldest club outside Great Britain; the
Royal CalcuttaGolf Club was founded in 1829, and the RoyalBombay Golf Club came about 12 years later. TheRoyal Calcutta initiated an amateur championship forIndia, and the two clubs paved the way for many inEast Asia. The Royal Bangkok Golf Club (1890) wasfirst housed in an ancient temple. Golf came to China when the Shanghai Golf Club wasformed in 1896, until which time the game was apparently unknown outside Hong Kong.The
Japanese a few years later constructed a course at Kōbe. The Tokyo Golf Club wasfounded in 1914. With the boom in the popularity of the game in Japan after World War II,players came to be numbered in the thousands, despite the fact that the shortage of open
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 9/25
land made the game enormously expensive to play. The first club in
Australia, the RoyalAdelaide Golf Club, was formed in 1870, and it is believed that the game was played inMelbourne in 1847 but went into abeyance for nearly half a century, the gold rush havingtaken priority over golf for the settlers.
New Zealand origins have been dated from theformation of the Christchurch Golf Club in 1873.
South Africa’s first course was at theMaritzburg Golf Club in Natal in 1884, though the Royal Cape Golf Club (1885) has beenrated as the country’s senior club.
On the European continent the first golf course was laid in France at Pau in 1856. Until1913, when the count of Gallifet was admitted as a member, the club “Golf de Pau”remained the preserve of Scottish residents at the foot of the Pyrenees, some of whom weredescendants of Wellington’s army. Biarritz Golf Club came into being in 1888, and CannesGolf Club was founded by the “King of Cannes,” the Russian grandduke Michael, in 1891.The French golf federation, the Union des Golfs de France, was inaugurated in 1912. InGermany, golf was first played by English tourists in spas such as Bad Homburg andWiesbaden. The first golf club in Germany, Berlin Golf Club, now Golf- und LandclubBerlin-Wannsee, was founded in 1895 and run by Anglo-Saxons. The German Federation(Deutscher Golfverband) was established in Hamburg in 1907. In Switzerland the first golfcourse, in Davos, was planned in 1895 by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who after its completionwas annoyed by the fact that cows enjoyed chewing up the red flags that marked the greens.
Development of equipment
How the ball is hit and directed is the essence of golf. The changing story of the ball’smanufacture falls broadly into well-defined phases, beginning with the “feathery,” whichwas used for centuries until it was superseded by gutta-percha.
The history of the
golf ball
The
feather-ball era
For many years golf balls were made from wood, but in the early 17th century feather ballswere introduced and were hailed as an advance. “Featheries” were manufactured bycompressing boiled feathers into the pieces of stitched leather that composed the cover. Forstuffing in the feathers a wooden tool was first used, after which the stuffing iron had tocomplete the job. When the leather case was crammed beyond increase, the hole wasstitched up and the case left to dry; then the ball was hammered and made as round aspossible and painted white. The whole process was so slow that the maker did well to finish
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 10/25
four balls in a day, so that they cost as much as five shillings each. Although the featherycould be hit a long way, it became sodden and disabled in wet weather and was destroyedby hacks from iron clubs, and thus the balls were short-lived as well as expensive.
The
gutta-percha era
Gutta-percha
, the evaporated milky juice or latex of various South American and SouthPacific island trees (especially those of Malaysia), is soft and impressible at the temperatureof boiling water but becomes hard and nonbrittle and retains its shape when cooled. It is notaffected by water except at boiling temperature. In the mid-1840s it was discovered to be asubstance ideal for the easy and efficient manufacture of golf balls; the manufacturingprocess consisted simply of boiling a strip of gutta-percha, molding it into a sphericalshape, and allowing it to dry.
It took a few years, however, for the potential of the “gutty” to be realized. The firstprototypes were smooth as billiard balls; they were difficult to get airborne and tended toduck (drop) quickly in flight. It was soon discovered that ball flight improved tremendouslyonce the ball acquired the nicks, cuts, and scuff marks that resulted from a round of play.Ball makers learned to mold balls with raised or indented surface patterns, thus ensuringproper flight.
The emergence of the gutta-percha in 1848 brought about a revolutionary change in thegame. The professionals had divided views, however. At St. Andrews
Allan Robertson, aleading manufacturer of feather balls, would have nothing to do with gutties at first; but
“Old Tom” Morris, who was then his assistant, wisely foresaw the possibilities of the newball, and on this issue the two actually parted company in 1852, Morris going into businesson his own (he returned to St. Andrews in 1859, after the death of Robertson). The ball washeartily welcomed by the golf community, not least for its economy (cost: one shillingeach), and its coming immediately swelled the golfing ranks.
The
rubber ball
The beginning of the 20th century introduced a new ball and a new era. The U.S. patent ofthe three-piece rubber ball—the invention of Coburn Haskell, a golfer from Cleveland, andBertram G. Work of the B.F. Goodrich Company—involved a tension-wound rubber threadaround a solid rubber core. The new design allowed for a ball that flew and rolled fartherthan a gutty; it was also easier to hit and gave its striker a greater sense of power. Oldermen found it easier to play, and hosts of women and children were drawn into the game.
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 11/25
Early concerns as to the controllability of the rubber ball were quelled when the 1901 U.S.Amateur and the 1902 U.S. Open and Open Championship (British Open) were won byplayers using the Haskell ball, defeating opponents playing gutties.
Early rubber balls were covered with a layer of gutta-percha molded into a pattern ofbumps (called a “bramble pattern”) that covered the entire surface. The Spalding companyintroduced a ball covered with
balata
, a natural rubber, in 1903; it proved more durable andeasier to control than gutta-percha. Experiments with ball design also revealed that ballswith indentations produced better results than balls with bumps (in that they reduced thedrag on a ball’s surface by increasing turbulence in flight), and in 1905 the dimpled coverwas patented by England’s William Taylor. A number of ball varieties then appeared frommanufacturers catering to the golfer’s desire to hit the ball farther. Length was the lure, andthe trade race upset the design of courses. Championship and other tees had to be sitedfarther back.
Another factor that greatly increased the popularity and playability of golf was theintroduction of the golf tee, patented in 1899 by George F. Grant, one of the first AfricanAmerican golfers. Previously players forged a tee from a pinch of wet sand or used otherearly tees made from cardboard, rubber, or steel. Grant’s invention increased the averageplayer’s chances of getting the ball airborne.
The 1.62 formula
Shortly after World War I the R&A enacted what is called the “1.62 formula”—that the ballshould have a maximum weight of 1.62 ounces (45.93 grams) and a minimum diameter of1.62 inches (4.11 cm). For two years the
USGA tried a ball which weighed 1.55 ounces(43.94 grams) and was 1.68 inches (4.27 cm) in diameter, but in 1932 it reverted to aweight of 1.62 ounces while retaining a diameter of 1.68 inches. This larger-sized Americanball was ruled mandatory by the British Professional Golf Association in 1968 and replacedthe smaller ball throughout the world by 1980.
By the turn of the 21st century, golf balls still conformed to the above standards, although ahost of new designs were available. Traditional three-piece balata-covered balls were stillpopular, but golfers could also choose from two-piece balls (with a solid core and a hardSurlyn cover), two-piece “performance” balls (with thicker cores and thinner covers,allowing for the feel and control of a three-piece ball), and three-piece double-cover balls(consisting of an inner core covered by two layers of varying hardness). Experiments in thesize, depth, and arrangement of dimples have also produced balls with longer flight and a
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 12/25
higher degree of backspin. Modern golf balls can have anywhere from 324 to 492 dimplesarranged in sophisticated patterns, such as multiple triangular or pentagonal groups.
A major challenge for ball manufacturers is to produce improved products that still conformto USGA standards. A ball that would travel 600 yards (550 metres) is more than possible,but such a ball would not conform to the USGA’s edict of 1942, which limited the velocityof a golf ball to 250 feet per second at impact. Nevertheless, ball makers have greatflexibility in terms of materials used, dimple patterns, and size and weight (providing thisdesign conforms to the standards of size and weight) and are free to design any ball thattakes advantage of such leeway.

), came to light in 1970 when the Dutch East Indiaman
Kennemerland
, sunk off the Shetland Islands in 1664, was excavated. Previously the oldestclubs known were discovered in a house in Hull, England, along with a newspaper carryinga date of 1741.
In the British Golf Museum at St. Andrews there are specimens of ancient clubs includingtwo woods and an especially notable putting cleek—i.e., a putter having an iron head on awooden shaft—made in the second half of the 18th century by Simon Cossar of Leith, clubmaker to the Company of Gentlemen Golfers. When
Allan Robertson (
see above
) of theR&A saw that golfing would not be ruined by the gutta-percha ball, he realized the value ofiron clubs for approach shots and made a cleek for steadier putting. Other developmentsincluded “Young Tom” (son of “Old Tom”)
Morris’s idea for the cup-faced niblick (whatwould be a nine iron in today’s parlance) for playing the shorter approaches.
The club makers of outstanding repute in the early 19th century were
Hugh Philip at St.Andrews and the McEwan brothers of Musselburgh, notably
Douglas, whose clubs weredescribed as models of symmetry and shape. They were artists at a time when clubs werepassing from “rude and clumsy bludgeons” to a new and handsome look.
Manufacturing methods
The hickory shafts of the woods—the play club (modern driver), the spoons, and the brassie—had been spliced to heads of apple or beech faced with horn. The harder rubber ball,

https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 13/25
however, brought about the use of persimmon wood and, later, laminated club heads. Hardinsets appeared in the faces. Increased demand led to the adaptation of shoe-last machinetools for the fashioning of wooden club heads. Sockets were bored in the club heads, andshafts were inserted rather than spliced. Drop-forging completely replaced hand forging inthe fashioning of iron clubs, and faces were deepened to accommodate the livelier ball andwere machine-lined to increase the spin on the ball in flight. Composition materials weredeveloped as an alternative to leather in grips, and the grip foundations were molded in somany ways that they were regulated in 1947. Inventive minds created novel clubs, not onlycentre-shafted and aluminum putters and the sand wedge but also types that were suchradical departures from the traditional form and make that they could not be approved bythe USGA or the R&A. In its revised code of 1908 the R&A ruled that it would not sanctionany substantial departure from the traditional form and make of golf clubs. This principlehas been invoked many times since then.
Improvement of the shaft was accompanied by the general introduction of numbered, ratherthan named, clubs and by the merchandising of matched sets rather than individual clubs.Clubs had become more numerous and more finely graduated than the names thattraditionally had been applied to them (brassie, spoon, niblick, mashie, etc.), and shaftscould be manufactured to specifications for flexibility and point of flex. Whereas formerlya golfer seeking new clubs went through a rack of mashies until he found one that “feltright” and then tried to find other clubs of similar feel, he later bought a whole setmanufactured to impart the same feel. The merchandising opportunities inherent in thenumbered and matched sets were carried to an extreme, and in 1938 the USGA limited thenumber of clubs a player might use in a round to 14. The R&A concurred in a similar edictthe next year.
Experiments with steel shafts went through several phases. In 1924 the Union HardwareCompany of Torrington, Connecticut, U.S., drew a seamless shaft of high-carbon steel thatcould be heat-treated and tempered. It was approved by the R&A in 1929 and substantiallyreplaced hickory in the early 1930s. In the 1960s aluminum shafts had a brief spurt ofpopularity; shafts of fibreglass, graphite, and titanium were introduced into the game in thedecades thereafter. By the 1970s the technique of investment casting, a method of castingrather than forging to enhance the perimeter weighting of iron clubs, was commonplace,and a decade later “woods” made of metal were in widespread use by tournamentprofessionals. The stainless-steel club heads of the 1980s gave way to titanium (alightweight, extremely hard metal) heads in the 1990s. By the turn of the 21st century, the
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 14/25
conversion to metal-head “woods” was near-complete. Virtually all touring professionalsused them, and the term
metals
was gradually replacing
woods
in golf parlance.
Players and tournaments
There is no doubt that the development of golf as an organized sport was distinctly British,and Britain produced the first great players of the game. As the early golfing associations,or clubs, became established in Scotland and then England, there emerged a group ofprofessionals who made golf balls, fashioned and repaired clubs, laid out and maintainedcourses, and gave lessons. Many of them were outstanding golfers and would take on allcomers in the popular stakes (money) matches of the day. Allan Robertson of St. Andrews,for example, was regarded as the greatest golfer of his time and, according to legend, wasnever beaten in a stakes match played on even terms (that is, without giving his opponent ahandicap). The British professionals and their amateur counterparts represented the bestgolf in the world from the second half of the 19th century, when the sport began to gainsome world prominence, up to about the 1920s, when American players began to excel.With the tremendous increases in financial rewards to be gained in golf during the latterhalf of the 20th century, especially on the U.S. professional tour, and with the greatmobility provided by jet transportation, golfers from other countries (e.g., Australia, NewZealand, South Africa, Japan, Fiji, Spain, and Argentina) began to appear in the toptournaments.
The premier championships
The most prestigious tournaments for nonprofessionals are the
British AmateurChampionship
and the
United States Amateur Championship
. For professionals the covetedGrand Slam tournaments are the
Masters
, the
U.S. Open
, the
Open Championship
(BritishOpen), and the
Professional Golfers’ Association (PGA) Championship
. The PlayersChampionship has also steadily gained in popularity and prestige, to the extent that it hasearned the unofficial designation of a “fifth major.” The
Walker Cup
for amateurs and the
Ryder Cup
for professionals are important team golfing tournaments that have pittedAmerican golfers against those of Europe.
British tournaments and players
The
Open Championship
of the British Isles, which the British like to call “the Open” toemphasize the tradition and priority of the event begun in 1860 (but which is also known asthe British Open), was the concept of the
Prestwick Club in Scotland, whose minutes

early professional golfers
Early professional golfers—including“Old Tom” Morris (right, with club)—onthe Leith Links golf course in Scotland,May 17, 1867.
recorded a proposal that all clubs should contribute toraise a fund for a trophy for professional competition.Their hope, however, was badly disappointed, and theoffer of support was so meagre that Prestwick decidedto go it alone and spent 30 guineas on the ornamentalchallenge belt to be awarded to the champion. Theearly championships were dominated by Willie Park,
“Old Tom” Morris, and his son,
“Young Tom,”
whoretired the belt by winning it three times insuccession, 1868–70. In the absence of a prize, therewas no championship in 1871; but the next year a cup, which has been in competition eversince, was put up.
At the end of the 19th century, England was producing great players.
John Henry Taylor
and
Harry Vardon
, together with
James Braid
, a Scotsman, among them won the OpenChampionship 16 times between 1894 and 1914. These three supreme golfers were knownas “the great triumvirate” and were primarily responsible for the formation of the
Professional Golfers Association in 1901. This body is responsible for professionaltournaments in Great Britain and for the biennial Ryder Cup match (for professionals) whenit is played there.
The
British Amateur Championship was started in 1885 after the Royal Liverpool GolfClub at Hoylake had proposed a tournament “open to all amateur golfers.” The tournamentattracted nearly all the best amateurs of the time, but it was not immediately recognized asthe championship. The following year the Royal Liverpool suggested to the R&A that thetournament be established as the Amateur Championship, and 24 clubs joined together topurchase a trophy and manage the event. Among British players who won the AmateurChampionship at least two times before the series was interrupted by World War I wereH.G. Hutchinson,
John Ball (who won it eight times), J.E. Laidlay, and H.H. Hilton. Theinterwar years were marked by many outstanding players, including
Cyril Tolley, Amateurchampion in 1920 and 1929;
Roger Wethered, Amateur champion in 1923; and ScotsHector Thomson, Jack McLean, and A.T. Kyle.
The Ladies’ Golf Union in Britain was formed in 1893. The first
Ladies’ British AmateurChampionship was held that year on the old St. Anne’s course in England. One of the firstoutstanding woman golfers was
Dorothy Campbell, who won the Ladies’ British AmateurChampionship in 1909 and 1911 and was runner-up in 1908. She won the U.S. Women’s
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 16/25
Amateur Championship in 1909, 1910, and 1924 and the Canadian championship in 1910,1911, and 1912. Among the many notable women who played championship golf betweenthe wars were
Joyce Wethered
(Roger Wethered’s sister) and
Cecil Leitch, each of whomwon the Ladies’ British Amateur title four times.
U.S. tournaments and players
The first official
U.S. Open,
Amateur, and Women’s Amateur championships were held in1895.
Walter J. Travis was the first great American golfer. He proved his ability as a golferby winning the U.S. Amateur (1900–03) and the British Amateur (1904, the only year heentered this event) titles.
Jerome D. Travers, the next great American champion, was aplayer with indomitable courage and nerve that rarely failed him. He won the U.S. AmateurChampionship (1907–08, 1912–13) and the U.S. Open title (1915).
After World War I the influence of the many Scottish golfers who had emigrated to theUnited States became evident. American golfers virtually monopolized the OpenChampionship in Britain until the mid-1930s. From the 1920s into the 1980s Americanteams dominated the Walker Cup and Ryder Cup matches, as American women golfers didthe Curtis Cup tournament from its inception in the 1930s.
American golfers had begun to show their prowess in 1913, when
Francis Ouimet
became anational hero by defeating Vardon and Edward Ray, two of the best British professionals,for the U.S. Open. Also notable was
Charles (“Chick”) Evans
, who was the first golfer towin the U.S. Open and Amateur in the same year (1916). But
Bobby Jones
has beenregarded as the greatest amateur golfer of modern times. His career was brilliant from hisdebut in national competition in the U.S. Amateur of 1916 until his unparalleledperformance in 1930 of winning all four of the world’s most difficult titles—the BritishAmateur, the Open Championship (British Open), the U.S. Amateur, and the U.S. Open.
The popular appeal of the U.S. Amateur Championship has been seriously weakened bydepartures to the professional ranks, however, and it has become exceptional for anAmateur champion to resist the lure of tournament money. In the late 1930s theprofessional circuit, underwritten by civic and club organizations throughout the country,began putting up major prize money for the experts. In 1936 aggregate prize money totaled$100,000. By 2000 the PGA was offering more than $135,000,000 in prizes annually.
The first outstanding American professional golfers were
Walter Hagen
and
Gene Sarazen
.Hagen, a colourful and stylish player known as “The Haig,” is credited with raising the
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 17/25
Arnold Palmer
social standing of golfers. His record of 11 major tournament victories ranks second on theall-time list. Sarazen attained a career Grand Slam; that is, he won the U.S. Open, the OpenChampionship (British Open), the PGA Championship, and the Masters Tournament duringthe course of his career. (It should be noted that when Bobby Jones won a Grand Slamduring the 1930 season, the four tournaments that constituted the Grand Slam weredifferent; the British Amateur and U.S. Amateur tournaments would be supplanted by thePGA Championship and the Masters.) Dominant players of the 1940s included
Sam Snead
,
Ben Hogan
,
Byron Nelson
, and
Jimmy Demaret. Snead, one of golf’s most humourous andingratiating players, was recognized for the easy grace of his natural, self-taught swing. His81 PGA Tour victories still stand as the all-time record for men (
Kathy Whitworth
holds therecord for the most tour wins, with 88 in the Ladies Professional Golf Association). Equallydominant was Hogan, who in many ways was the polar opposite of Snead. An aloof, intenseplayer nicknamed “the Hawk,” Hogan possessed a swing regarded as technically perfectand almost machinelike in consistency. Critically injured in an auto accident in 1949,Hogan was not expected to walk, let alone play golf, again, but he adhered to a rigorousexercise program and returned to the game within a year. His fragile legs allowed him toplay only a limited schedule, but many feel that Hogan played his best golf after hiscomeback. In 1953 he became the first player to win three major tournaments (the Masters,the U.S. Open, and the Open Championship [British Open]) within a single season.
Golf steadily increased in popularity throughout the20th century, becoming something of a worldwidephenomenon in the late 1950s and early ’60s. Thecatalyst for this was
Arnold Palmer
. Handsome,charismatic, and possessing an exciting, go-for-brokestyle of play, Palmer was the perfect star for the newage of television coverage in golf. A major drawingcard at tournaments, his legions of fans became known as “Arnie’s Army.” He became thefirst player to win four Masters Tournaments, which he accomplished in every even-numbered year from 1958 to 1964.
His popularity was such that many resented the arrival of the comparatively dour
JackNicklaus
, who turned professional in 1962 and was soon to dominate the game. In time,however, Nicklaus captured the hearts of golf fans throughout the world and came to beregarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the game. A career Grand Slamwinner, Nicklaus holds the all-time record of 18 victories in the major professional
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 18/25
tournaments. He achieved his final major victory at age 46 in the 1986 Masters, regarded asone of the most memorable and emotional moments in golf history.
Also dominant during the 1960s and ’70s were the South African
Gary Player
(anothercareer Grand Slam winner) and the Americans
Billy Casper and
Lee Trevino
. Otheroutstanding players of these and the following decades included
Tom Watson
,
JohnnyMiller,
Chi Chi Rodriguez,
Raymond Floyd,
Hale Irwin,
Greg Norman
,
Seve Ballesteros
,
José Maria Olazabal,
Davis Love III, and
Vijay Singh.
By the 1990s it seemed inconceivable that any single player would come along to challengeNicklaus’s dominance, Palmer’s popularity, or Hogan’s precision. The inconceivablehappened in 1997 with the emergence of
Tiger Woods
. Heavily touted in the press for yearsas a child prodigy (he is reported to have shot 48 for nine holes at age three), Woods at age21 fulfilled his promise by winning the 1997 Masters with a record score of 270 and by arecord margin of 12 strokes. At his young age he was already one of the most powerful anddisciplined players in golf history, his game exhibiting no weaknesses in any area. Woodswent on to achieve within the next four years what many top golfers can only dream ofaccomplishing within a lifetime. At age 24 he utterly dominated the U.S. Open and OpenChampionship (British Open) tournaments of 2000 and became the youngest player toachieve a career Grand Slam. He scored his second Masters victory in 2001, thus becomingthe first to hold all four major professional titles simultaneously, an accomplishmentregarded as one of the great feats in the history of professional sports. Before Woods’sarrival, it would have seemed absurd to tout so young a player as the greatest in the game’shistory, yet he has been afforded such praise by the likes of Nicklaus, Snead, and otherveteran players. That he is of African American and Asian descent is also significant in that,within a few short years, he almost single-handedly transformed a game that once seemedthe domain of white males into one that is now enjoyed by all ethnic groups. He is perhapsthe perfect embodiment of golf’s potential in the 21st century.
The
Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA)
Several professional tournaments for women were staged during the 1920s and ’30s;important players from this era include
Glenna Collett
from the United States and
JoyceWethered
of Great Britain. It was not until the 1940s that efforts began in earnest to form aprofessional golf organization for women. The first, the Women’s Professional GolfAssociation (WPGA), was chartered in 1944. Standout players soon emerged, including
Patty Berg
,
Louise Suggs
,
Betty Jameson, and, especially, the multisport legend
Mildred
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 19/25
(“Babe”) Didrikson Zaharias
. Even Zaharias’s popularity, however, could not ensuresuccess for the WPGA, which folded in 1949. Nevertheless, it proved within its briefexistence the need for a professional women’s organization.
The
Ladies Professional Golf Association
(LPGA) was incorporated in August 1950 by theaforementioned golfers plus eight others. Funding for LPGA tournaments was at first sopoor that golfers themselves performed many of the organizational tasks and coursemaintenance chores. Soon, however, the introduction of the Weathervane series oftournaments (a series of four 36-hole tournaments that offered a $3,000 prize for eachtournament and a $5,000 prize for the overall winner of the four) proved sufficientlypopular to sustain the organization throughout the decade.
The play of such outstanding golfers as
Kathy Whitworth
,
Mickey Wright
,
Carol Mann,
Sandra Haynie, and
Sandra Palmer helped maintain a reasonable level of popularity for theLPGA throughout the 1960s. Star players who emerged during the following decadeinclude
Jan Stephenson,
Jo-Anne Carner,
Amy Alcott, and
Judy Rankin. The most notableplayer to emerge during the ’70s was
Nancy Lopez
, who, by winning nine tournaments(including a record five straight) during her first full season on the tour (1978), was a majorforce in increasing the popularity and prestige of the LPGA.
Pat Daniel,
Betsy King,
Patty Sheehan
,
Juli Inkster
, and
Laura Davies were among the topplayers of the 1980s and ’90s. By the turn of the century, when the annual purse for LPGAevents had increased to more than $37 million per year, the tour was dominated by suchplayers as
Karrie Webb
,
Annika Sörenstam
, and
Pak Se Ri
. Sörenstam made headlines in2001 by becoming the first female golfer to score 59 in competition and by becoming onlythe fourth player in LPGA history (after Whitworth, Wright, and Lopez) to win fourconsecutive tournaments.
International competition
Matches and tournaments
The first organized series of regular international matches were between Great Britain andthe
United States. The amateur team match between the two countries for the
Walker Cup
was inaugurated in 1922, and the professional team match for the
Ryder Cup
in 1927. Thewomen’s amateur team match for the
Curtis Cup
began in 1932. Although the competitionin all these contests has often been close, the U.S. teams managed to win the cups withgreat consistency. In an attempt to bring parity to the Ryder Cup, the format was changed in
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 20/25
1979 to broaden the British team to include continental European players as well. Thisstrategy has proved successful, and subsequent Ryder Cup matches have been fiercelycontended, with both teams exhibiting excellent play. Between 1979 and 2000 the UnitedStates won six times and Europe four times, while one match (1989) ended in a tie.
Circuits
The coming of jet transport stimulated competition. Ocean hopping became routine,enabling outstanding players from such places as South America, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, Fiji, Spain, Japan, and Korea to compete in the premier championships inGreat Britain and the United States and on the lucrative U.S. PGA Tour. Since beinglaunched in 1971, the PGA European Tour has grown in terms of prestige and prize moneyto the extent that American players are frequent participants. By the turn of the 21stcentury, professional golf was a worldwide phenomenon, with players of variousnationalities competing on multiple international tours.
Golf in the
Olympic Games
Golf was included in the program of the
Paris 1900 Olympic Games
, the second modern
Olympic Games
. That competition consisted of a 36-hole stroke-play event for men and a9-hole event for women. A men’s team event replaced the women’s competition for the
1904 St. Louis Games
, but afterward golf was discontinued as an Olympic sport for over acentury. In 2016 golf returned to the Olympics as a 72-hole stroke-play event for men andwomen.
The
Senior PGA Tour
Begun in the early 1980s, the Senior PGA Tour (later renamed the Champions Tour)quickly became popular. Designed for golfers 50 years of age and up, its total purse was$10 million within a few years of its creation, and it had swelled to some $50 million by2000. Although veterans such as Nicklaus, Palmer,
Trevino,
Rodriguez, and
Irwin were nolonger competing with the young men of the PGA Tour on a daily basis, they extended theircompetitive careers into the 21st century with this tour, demonstrating some excellent golfin the process.
Play of the game
Courses
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 21/25
The game consists of playing the ball from a teeing ground into a hole by successivestrokes in accordance with the rules. The stipulated round consists of 18 holes, and mostgolf courses have 18. Standard 18-hole courses measure from 6,500 to 7,000 yards (5,900to 6,400 metres); individual holes are from 100 to 600 yards (90 to 550 metres). Somecourses have only nine holes; these are played twice in a stipulated round. The clubs aredesigned for the various positions in which the ball may come to rest and for the variousdistances to the hole. The objective is to hole the ball in the fewest strokes.
In the early 19th century there was no agreement on the number of holes on a golf course;localities differed widely in the matter. When the popularity of Leith, with its five holes,waned and
St. Andrews became the hub, the round of 18 holes was established. Originallythe St. Andrews holes filed straight out alongside the shore and were played in reverse forthe return journey—11 holes each way. In 1764 the round was modified to 18 holes. Thevariety of courses gives golf an intrinsic charm.
Equipment
Golf balls
Regulation balls have a maximum weight of 1.62 ounces (45.93 grams) and a minimumdiameter of 1.68 inches (4.27 cm). In U.S. competition the velocity of the ball may notexceed 250 feet per second when measured under prescribed conditions on an apparatusmaintained by the USGA, but there is no velocity specification for British play.
Golf clubs
In the average good player’s set there are usually either 3 or 4 wood clubs and 9 or 10 irons(no more than 14 clubs may be carried during a round). No two clubs in a set are the same.There are differences in length and suppleness of shaft, weight, size, and shape of head, theangle at which the shaft ends and the head begins (the lie), and the angle of the face of theclub from the vertical (the loft).
The various clubs are known both by number and by name. The number of a club largelydesignates its length and the pitch of its head, which translates into the distance and heighta club will drive a ball. Generally, the lower the number, the greater the distance potential;distance decreases and pitch (thus height) increases progressively as club numbers go up.The woods (or metals) are mostly used for driving the longer distances. Sources differ onthe name equivalency of the numbered clubs, but the most widely used clubs may beidentified as follows:
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 22/25
Woods: number 1 (driver), number 2 (brassie), number 3 (spoon), number 4 (baffy), and number 5 (replacesnumber 3 or 4 iron).
Irons: number 1 (driving iron), number 2 (midiron), number 3 (mid-mashie), number 4 (mashie iron), number5 (mashie), number 6 (spade mashie), number 7 (mashie-niblick), number 8 (pitching niblick), number 9(niblick), number 10 (wedge), and putter (carries no number).
Rules
The rule-making bodies for golf are the R&A and the USGA. They attempt to perpetuateuniformity in rules by exchanging views on interpretations and on recommendations forrevision. The present code makes an amazing contrast with the first rules, 13 in number,that were framed by the
Honourable Company. The first of them ordained that the ball hadto be teed within a club length of the previous hole and the tee had to be on the ground. Teeand green were one. The ball struck from the tee was not to be changed, and the playercould (rule 5) take his ball out of water or “watery filth” to play it and allow his opponent astroke. The St. Andrews golfers, in founding the R&A, adopted almost exactly the Leithrules. There were periodical reforms before the rules committee of the R&A was formed in1897 to become the final authority.
The rules committee has co-opted representatives from the Commonwealth, the EuropeanGolf Federation, the United States, and the British Unions Advisory Committee. Britain andthe United States have had separate codes at various times, but a uniform code went intoeffect in 1967.
The rules of golf define an
amateur golfer as “one who plays the game solely as anonremunerative and non-profit-making sport.” But the elasticity of this definition perturbsthe game’s legislators for what it does not define. The whole question of status in itsvarious aspects engages the attention jointly of the R&A and the USGA. In general, anamateur remains so until and unless he takes specific action toward becoming aprofessional, even though he might have indicated his intention of becoming a professionalin the future.
Procedure
The starting place for each hole to be played is the
teeing ground. The front is indicated bytwo markers, and the teeing ground is the rectangular space two club lengths in depthdirectly behind the line indicated by the markers. The player tees his ball anywhere withinthis space, usually setting it up on a small wooden or plastic peg (called a tee), and strikes ittoward the hole. The stroke from the teeing ground is called the drive. For this the player
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 23/25
usually employs a number 1 wood club, or driver, although, to avoid a hazard or to attemptto place his ball in a favourable position for his second shot (for example, on a long holewith a sharp bend, or dogleg), he may prefer one of the other woods or an iron. On short,par-three holes most players use an iron.
The preferred line to the hole is generally a clear, mowed route called the
fairway. Thefairway was historically bordered by unmowed vegetation—heather, grasses, weeds, bushes—called rough. Most modern courses in the United States, however, are not characterizedby deep and tangled rough and when inland make effective use of trees. At strategic placesalong the preferred line to the hole and guarding the putting green are obstacles called
bunkers, depressions filled with sand (sand traps). Some holes require the player to crossstreams or ponds. Both bunkers and bodies of water are termed
hazards
.
Middle irons are used until the player has come within close range of the green. Twomethods of play are then open for the approach shot: the golfer may pitch the ball all theway and depend on backspin to stop it near the pin, or he may play a
chip shot, in which theball flies partway through the air, as to the edge of the close-clipped surface of the
green,and then rolls the remaining distance.
The hole itself measures 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) in diameter and at least 4 inches (10.2 cm)deep, and it is set in an area of turf especially prepared and maintained and closely mowedfor
putting. When the player putts, he uses a straight-faced club and rolls the ball across theputting green toward and eventually into the hole.
Forms of play
Match and medal play
There are two distinct forms of play: match play and stroke (medal) play. In
match play theplayer and his opponent are playing together and competing only against each other, whilein stroke play each competitor is competing against every other player in the tournament. Inmatch play the game is played by holes, and each hole is won by the player who holes hisball in the fewest strokes. If both players score the same number of strokes, the hole ishalved. When a player has won one more hole than his opponents, he is said to be one up.The match is won by the player who is leading by a number of holes greater than thenumber of holes remaining to be played, as, for example, three up and two to play. In strokeplay the competitor who holes the stipulated round or rounds in the fewest total strokes isthe winner. Amateur championships once were all at match play, and open championships
20/01/2024, 11:59 golf -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia
https://www.britannica.com/print/article/238012 24/25
and most professional events at stroke play, covering four 18-hole rounds. Some amateurevents have adopted stroke play (the match play U.S. Amateur event was competed atstroke play from 1965 to 1973), as has the U.S. PGA Championship.
Stroke play requires a greater degree of consistency in a player, for one hole where helapses into a high figure can ruin his total and cost him victory. The same high score on ahole in match play means only the loss of that hole. In both match and stroke play, playerscan compete as individuals or as partners. When two players compete as partners, eachplaying his own ball, the better ball on each hole is their score for that hole; this is a four-ball or best-ball match. Two players may compete as partners with two others, each pairplaying alternate strokes on a single ball; this is a match foursome. The advent of televisedchampionships wrote the death notice for match play in professional golf. By schedulingthe leaders together on the final round, exciting finishes are made most probable.
Handicaps
Players of varying abilities compete against each other by using handicaps. A handicap isthe number of strokes a player receives to adjust his score to a common level. The better theplayer, the smaller his handicap, and the best players have handicaps of zero (scratchplayers). A scratch player whose average score is 70 can have an even match with a playerwhose average score is 80 by giving him a handicap of 10 strokes. Handicap golf is limitedto amateur competitions, and championship tournaments are played without handicaps.
Par golf
Every course has a
par, which is defined as the score an expert (i.e., a scratch player) wouldbe expected to make, and many courses also have a
bogey, which is defined as the scorethat a moderately good golfer would be expected to make. Both
par
and
bogey
are furtherdefined as errorless play without flukes and under ordinary weather conditions, allowingtwo strokes on the putting green.
Par
is essentially an American term that came into use inthe early 1900s as a base for computing handicaps.
Bogey
is essentially a British term thatcame into use in England in 1891 and was derived from a mythical Colonel Bogey, whowas described as uniformly steady but never overbrilliant. Colloquially in the
United States,
bogey
is used to indicate a score one stroke above par.

Par-three golf courses, on which each hole measures 100 yards (90 metres) more or less andplays at par three, were developed as a result of the shortage of available open land incongested urban areas. Whereas a regulation 18-hole course may stretch to more than 7,000yards, about 4 miles (6.4 km), an 18-hole par-three, or short-hole, course can be laid out inabout 1,800 yards (1.6 km).
Driving ranges
Driving ranges were developed as commercial establishments at which golfers and aspiringgolfers could, for a small fee, practice their swings. They, too, have appealed to golfers inareas in which courses are overcrowded and are especially popular in
Japan, where suchconditions prevail.
